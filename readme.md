FriendsRecommend (In progress)
================

A repo for collecting data and creating a recommender system (still at a very early stage, not much to run at the moment).

To run:

1. create a dev acc at http://developer.echonest.com/ (an upgraded account is really recommended)
2. create environment variable "ECHO_NEST_API_KEY" with value "Your-API-Key"
3. run whatever main class you want to run
